#Hello World

This code was written early in the course as part of an intro to C and intro to the Raspberry Pi 3 exercise. The shell script performs some basic hardware characterization of the Raspberry Pi. The hello-bare-metal generates binary that, when cross compiled to ARM, will toggle the logic state of GPIO 16 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
